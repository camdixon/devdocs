Robo is a task runner for PHP that allows you to alias long, complex command line interface (CLI) commands to simple commands.

## Usage

### Format

Assuming that you're working in the `magento2/dev/tests/acceptance` directory in your terminal, run Robo commands using the following format:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo command [options] [arguments]
```

Or, if you added the path of the Robo executable file to the system *PATH*, then run Robo commands using the following format:

```bash
$ robo command [options] [arguments]
```

### Example

* Original: `$ allure generate tests/_output/allure-results/ -o tests/_output/allure-report/`
* Robo: `$ vendor/bin/robo allure1:generate`

## Useful commands

The following are the most popular commands used to interact with the MFTF. For more commands, see [Reference] or run in your terminal: `$ vendor/bin/robo`.

### Codeception Robo Commands

#### List all available Robo commands:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo
```

#### Duplicate the example configuration files used to customize the project:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo clone:files
```

#### Build the Codeception project:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo build:project
```

#### Generate all tests in PHP:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo generate:tests
```

#### Run all tests marked with the @group tag `example`, using the Chrome environment:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo example
```

#### Run all functional tests located under the directory path provided:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo folder ______
```

#### Run all functional tests, excluding @group skip:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo functional
```

#### Run all tests with the specified @group tag, excluding @group 'skip':

```bash
$ vendor/bin/robo group ______
```
  
### Allure Robo commands

To determine which version of the Allure command you need to use run `allure --version`.

#### Generate the HTML for the Allure report based on the test XML output:

Allure v1.x.x | Allure v2.x.x
---|---
`$ vendor/bin/robo allure1:generate` | `$ vendor/bin/robo allure2:generate`

#### Open the HTML Allure report:

Allure v1.x.x | Allure v2.x.x
---|---
`$ vendor/bin/robo allure1:open` | `$ vendor/bin/robo allure2:open`

#### Generate and open the HTML Allure report:

Allure v1.x.x | Allure v2.x.x
---|---
`$ vendor/bin/robo allure1:report` | `$ vendor/bin/robo allure2:report`

#### build
 
`build:project`     | Clone the example configuration files and build the Codeception project.

#### clone
  
`clone:files`       | Duplicate the example configuration files used to customize the project.

#### generate

Generate PHP code from the tests defined in XML files.
Path to a directory with generated tests:  `tests/functional/Magento/FunctionalTest/_generated/`.

`generate:tests`   | Generate all tests based on specific module load order of the Magento instance
`generate:tests --force`   | Generate all tests regardless of whether a Magento instance is available

`generate:tests --config parallel --nodes <number of nodes>`   | Generate all tests and a directory with manifest files, which is `_generated/groups/`. The number of files corresponds to the number of nodes. Each file contains a proportional list of tests ordered across files from largest to smallest (based on number of actions).
