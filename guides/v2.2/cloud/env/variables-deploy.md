The following _deploy_ variables control actions in the deploy phase and can inherit and override values from the [Global stage]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/env/variables-intro.html#global-variables). Also, you can override the [`ADMIN_` variables]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/env/environment-vars_magento.html).

See [Manage build and deploy actions](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/cloud/project/magento-env-yaml.html) for more information about using these options in the `.magento.env.yaml` file.
For information on the build and deploy process, see [Deployment process]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/reference/discover-deploy.html).

### `CACHE_CONFIGURATION`

-  **Default**—_Not set_
-  **Version**—Magento 2.1.4 and later

Use to configure Redis page and default caching. 

```
stage:
  global:
  build:
  deploy:
    CACHE_CONFIGURATION:
      frontend:
        default:
          backend: file
        page_cache:
          backend: file
```

By default, the deployment process overwrites all settings in the `env.php` file. When setting the `cm_cache_backend_redis` parameter, you must specify the `server`, `port`, and `database` options.

### `CLEAN_STATIC_FILES`

-  **Default**—`enabled`
-  **Version**—Available in all versions

The default value, `enabled`, cleans [generated static view files]({{page.baseurl}}config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-static-view.html#config-cli-static-overview) when you perform an action like enabling or disabling a component. We recommend the default value in development. The supported values are `enabled` and `disabled`.

Failure to clear static view files might result in issues if there are multiple files with the same name and you do not clear all of them.

Because of [static file fallback]({{page.baseurl}}howdoi/clean_static_cache.html) rules, if you do not clear static files and there is more than one file named `logo.gif` that are different, fallback might cause the wrong file to display.

### `CRON_CONSUMERS_RUNNER`

-  **Default**—_Not set_
-  **Version**—Magento 2.1.4 and later

Use this environment variable to make sure message queues are running after a deployment. By default, the deployment process overwrites all settings in the `env.php` file. Refer to [Manage message queues]({{page.baseurl}}config-guide/mq/manage-mysql.html) for more information about how this works in {{site.data.var.ce}} and {{site.data.var.ee}}.

### `CRYPT_KEY`

-  **Default**—_Not set_
-  **Version**—Magento 2.1.4 and later

Use the Project Web UI to set this value. When you move the database from one environment to another without an installation process, you need the corresponding cryptographic information. Magento uses the encryption key value set in the Web UI as the `crypt/key` value in the `env.php` file. This does not overwrite an existing encryption key value in the `env.php` file.

### `DO_DEPLOY_STATIC_CONTENT`

-  **Default**—`disabled`
-  **Version**—Available in all versions

You can forcefully enable or disable the deployment of static content during the deploy phase with this variable. If you already completed static content deployment in the build phase, and this variable is enabled, it is overridden to ensure static content deployment occurs only once. We strongly recommend always deploying static content during the build phase.

### `MAGENTO_CLOUD_MODE`

-  **Default**—`enterprise`
-  **Version**—Available in all versions

We manage the values and setting of this variable. It identifies the type of environment as part of Integration, Staging, or Production. For example, for Pro, this value may be `enterprise` indicating Staging and Production. For `enterprise`, it sets the `STATIC_CONTENT_THREADS` to `3`, otherwise sets it to 1 for Integration. This is highly important for Pro plans Production, which has a three node high availability architecture with a very different technology stack.

### `QUEUE_CONFIGURATION`

-  **Default**—_Not set_
-  **Version**—Magento 2.1.4 and later

Use this environment variable to retain customized AMQP service settings between deployments. For example, if you prefer using an existing message queue service, like RabbitMQ, instead of relying on {{site.data.var.ece}} to create it for you, use the `QUEUE_CONFIGURATION` environment variable to connect it to your site:

```
stage:
  global:
  build:
  deploy:
        QUEUE_CONFIGURATION:
          amqp:
            host: test.host
            port: 1234
          amqp2:
            host: test.host2
            port: 12345
          mq:
            host: mq.host
            port: 1234
```

By default, the deployment process overwrites all settings in the `env.php` file.

### `SCD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL`

-  **Default**—`6`
-  **Version**—Magento 2.1.x

Specifies which [gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip){target="\_blank} compression level (`0` to `9`) to use when compressing static content; `0` disables compression.

### `SCD_STRATEGY`

-  **Default**—`standard`
-  **Version**—Magento 2.2.0 and later

Allows you to customize the [deployment strategy](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-static-deploy-strategies.html) for static content. Refer to [Deploy static view files](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-static-view.html) for more information.

Use these options _only_ if you have more than one locale:

-  `standard`—deploys all static view files for all packages.
-  `quick`—minimizes deployment time. This is the default command option if not specified.
-  `compact`—conserves disk space on the server. If you use `compact`, it overrides the value for `scd_threads` with a value of `1`. This strategy does not work with multi-threads.

### `SEARCH_CONFIGURATION`

-  **Default**—_Not set_
-  **Version**—Magento 2.1.4 and later

Use this environment variable to retain customized search service settings between deployments. For example:

```
stage:
  global:
  build:
  deploy:
   SEARCH_CONFIGURATION:
     engine: elasticsearch
     elasticsearch_server_hostname: hostname
     elasticsearch_server_port: '123456'
     elasticsearch_index_prefix: magento
     elasticsearch_server_timeout: '15'
```

By default, the deployment process overwrites all settings in the `env.php` file. 

### `SESSION_CONFIGURATION`

-  **Default**—_Not set_
-  **Version**—Magento 2.1.4 and later

Use to configure Redis session storage. You must specify the `save`, `redis`, `host`, `port`, and `database` options for the session storage variable. For example:

```
stage: 
  build: ~
  deploy: 
    SESSION_CONFIGURATION: 
      redis: 
        bot_first_lifetime: 100
        bot_lifetime: 10001
        database: 0
        disable_locking: 1
        host: redis.internal
        max_concurrency: 10
        max_lifetime: 10001
        min_lifetime: 100
        port: 6379
      save: redis
```

By default, the deployment process overwrites all settings in the `env.php` file. 

### `STATIC_CONTENT_EXCLUDE_THEMES`

-  **Default**—_Not set_
-  **Version**—Available in all versions

Themes can include numerous files. Set this variable to true if you want to skip copying over theme files during deployment. For example, the Luma theme is included with {{site.data.var.ece}}. You may not need to constantly deploy this theme with your code updates and deployments. To exclude the `Magento/luma` theme:

```
 stage:
  build:
    SCD_EXCLUDE_THEMES: Magento/luma 
```

### `STATIC_CONTENT_SYMLINK`

-  **Default**—`enabled`
-  **Version**—Available in all versions

Generates symlinks for static content, unless you disable it using this environment variable. This setting is vital in the Pro Production environment for the three node cluster. When this variable is not set (disabled), it must copy every file during the deployment, which increases deployment time. Setting `SCD_ON_DEMAND` to `true` disables this variable.

### `STATIC_CONTENT_THREADS`

-  **Default**: 
    -  `1`—Starter environments and Pro Integration environments
    -  `3`—Pro Staging and Production environments
-  **Version**—Available in all versions

Sets the number of threads for processing and deploying static content files. The higher amount of threads increasing the amount of files processed during the deployment. The lower the number of threads, the slower static files are processed increasing deployment time.

For Starter plan environments and Pro Integration environments, the threads value is `1`. This amount is fine for these environments. For Pro Staging and Production environments, the default threads is `3` to increase the speed of processing static content, especially for Production with three nodes and GlusterFS.

To further reduce deployment time, we recommend using [Configuration Management]({{page.baseurl}}cloud/live/sens-data-over.html) with the `scd-dump`command to move static deployment into the build phase.

### `UPDATE_URLS`

-  **Default**—`enabled`
-  **Version**—Magento 2.1.2 and later

On deployment, replace Magento base URLs in the database with project URLs. This is useful for local development, where base URLs are set up for your local environment. When you deploy to a Cloud environment, we change the URLs so you can access your storefront and Magento Admin using project URLs.

You should set this variable to `disabled` _only_ in Staging or Production environments, where the base URLs cannot change. For Pro, we already set this to `disabled` for you.

### `VERBOSE_COMMANDS`

-  **Default**—`disabled`
-  **Version**—Available in all versions

 Enables or disables the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/console/verbosity.html">Symfony</a> debug verbosity level for your logs. Be aware, if you enable this verbosity, the logs will be deeply detailed.
