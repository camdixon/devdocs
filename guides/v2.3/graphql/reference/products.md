Attribute |  Description
--- | ---
`search` | Performs a full-text search using the specified key words. This attribute is optional. See [Searches and pagination in GraphQL]({{page.baseurl}}graphql/search-pagination.html) for more information.
`filter` | Identifies which attributes to search for and return. This attribute is required. See [ProductFilterInput](#ProductFilterInput) for more information.
`pageSize` | Specifies the maximum number of results to return at once. The default value is 20. See [Searches and pagination in GraphQL]({{page.baseurl}}graphql/search-pagination.html) for more information.
`currentPage` | Specifies which page of results to return. The default value is 1. See [Searches and pagination in GraphQL]({{page.baseurl}}graphql/search-pagination.html) for more information.

## ProductFilterInput object {#ProductFilterInput}

The `ProductFilterInput` object defines the filters to be used in the search. A filter contains at least one attribute, a comparison operator, and the value that is being searched for. The following example filter searches for products that has a `sku` that contains the string `24-MB` with a `price` that's less than `50`.

{% highlight json %}
filter: {
       sku: {like: "24-MB%"}
       price: {lt: "50"}
       }
{% endhighlight %}


See [Searches and pagination in GraphQL]({{page.baseurl}}graphql/search-pagination.html) for more information about the operators.

Magento processes the attribute values specified in  a `ProductFilterInput` as  simple data types (strings, integers, booleans). However, returned attributes can be a different, complex, data type. For example, in a response, `price` is an object that contains a monetary value and a currency code.

The following attributes can be used to create filters. See the [Response](#Response) section for information about each attribute.

```
